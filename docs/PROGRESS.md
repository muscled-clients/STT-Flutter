# Development Progress Log

## Project: Mental Math Voice
**Start Date**: 2025-08-23  
**Developer**: AI Assistant + Human  
**Objective**: Flutter app with offline STT (whisper.cpp) for mental math narration

---

## Day 1: Planning & Documentation
**Date**: 2025-08-23  
**Time**: Session Start

### Completed
- âœ… Created comprehensive project documentation
  - README.md with feature list and development backlog
  - SETUP.md with detailed build instructions for Android/iOS
  - ARCHITECTURE.md with clean architecture design and data flow
  - PARSING_SPEC.md with grammar rules and 40+ test examples
  - TEST_PLAN.md with coverage goals and test strategies

### Decisions Made
1. **Architecture**: Clean Architecture with 4 layers (Presentation, Application, Domain, Infrastructure)
2. **State Management**: Riverpod for its compile-safety and testing benefits
3. **FFI Strategy**: C wrapper around whisper.cpp with dart:ffi bindings
4. **Parser Design**: AST-based with recursive evaluation
5. **Testing Goal**: 90% coverage for parser, 80% overall

### Technical Notes
- Whisper model: base.en (74MB) as default, tiny.en (39MB) as fallback
- Audio format: 16kHz mono PCM
- Performance target: RTF < 0.5 on mid-range devices
- Memory budget: < 150MB peak usage

### Next Steps
1. Create Flutter project with clean architecture structure
2. Add Riverpod and core dependencies
3. Scaffold basic navigation (Record/History/Settings)
4. Implement mock STT service for UI development
5. Begin audio capture pipeline

### Blockers/Issues
- None currently

### Performance Metrics
- N/A (planning phase)
